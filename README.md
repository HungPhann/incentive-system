# incentive-system
[Bachelor Thesis Project]
The EU SimpliCITY project attempts to raise the usage of smart city services (e.g. bike mobility, local consumption, social inclusion) by encouraging both physical and digital participation using incentivization methods with monetary incentive as an approach. Since government cannot be a single source of sponsor with limited amount of budget for a long-term campaign, the project needs more support from companies or organizations. In the author's idea, companies joining the system form an ecosystem which not only rewards people with discount for any sustainable activity but also encourages people using their products as win-win relationship.
The goal of this project is to design a decentralized incentive platform that could be used as a transparent network for companies to solve the problem of trustiness among sponsors.
